# ClassFlow Pro Functionality Audit

## Summary
The plugin has a solid architectural foundation with most core functionality implemented. However, there are several missing pieces and placeholder content that need to be addressed.

## ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Components

### 1. Core Services
- **ClassService**: Complete implementation with create, update, delete, search, duplicate functionality
- **BookingService**: Full booking lifecycle management with validation and conflict checking
- **PaymentService**: Stripe Payment Intents integration (but missing Stripe Connect)
- **NotificationService**: Email notification system with template support

### 2. Database Layer
- **Database Class**: Proper wpdb wrapper with transactions support
- **All Repositories**: Real database queries with proper escaping and formatting
- **Schema**: All 13 tables properly defined in Activator

### 3. REST API
- **RestApiManager**: Complete REST endpoints for classes, schedules, bookings, and payments
- All endpoints have proper permission checks and response formatting

### 4. Frontend
- **Shortcodes**: All shortcodes have real implementations (not just placeholders)
- **JavaScript**: frontend.js has complete booking flow with Stripe payment handling
- **AJAX Handlers**: All registered AJAX actions have corresponding handler methods

## ‚ùå Missing/Placeholder Components

### 1. Admin Pages
All admin pages are currently **PLACEHOLDERS** with minimal HTML:
- ClassesPage.php - Only shows basic list/form UI
- SchedulesPage.php - Just title and description
- BookingsPage.php - Just title and description
- StudentsPage.php - Just title and description
- InstructorsPage.php - Just title and description
- PaymentsPage.php - Just title and description
- ReportsPage.php - Just title and description
- SettingsPage.php - Just title and description

**Impact**: Admin cannot actually manage any data through the WordPress admin interface.

### 2. Email Templates
The `templates/emails/` directory is **EMPTY**. Missing templates:
- booking-confirmation.php
- booking-cancellation.php
- booking-rescheduled.php
- payment-confirmation.php
- payment-failed.php
- refund-confirmation.php
- class-reminder.php
- waitlist-available.php
- instructor-new-booking.php
- instructor-booking-cancelled.php
- admin-notification.php

**Impact**: Email notifications will fail because template files don't exist.

### 3. Stripe Connect Integration
**COMPLETELY MISSING** despite user's specific request:
- No onboarding flow for instructors
- No connected account management
- No platform fees or transfers
- No instructor payout functionality

**Impact**: Cannot pay instructors through the platform.

### 4. Missing Dependencies
- `vendor/` directory doesn't exist
- Required packages not installed:
  - stripe/stripe-php
  - nesbot/carbon
  - ramsey/uuid

**Impact**: Plugin will fatal error on activation due to missing autoloader.

### 5. Frontend Templates
The `templates/frontend/` directory exists but is empty. Missing:
- Single class template
- Archive templates
- Account pages
- Booking confirmation pages

### 6. CSS Styling
While CSS files exist, they appear to be empty or minimal. Missing:
- Admin styling
- Frontend component styles
- Responsive design
- Calendar styling

## üîß Partially Implemented

### 1. Settings Management
- Settings class exists and is used throughout
- But no UI to actually configure settings
- Default values are hardcoded in Activator

### 2. User Roles
- Roles are created on activation
- But no UI to manage instructor/student profiles
- No onboarding flow for new users

### 3. Booking System
- Core booking logic works
- But missing features like:
  - Group bookings
  - Recurring bookings
  - Package redemption UI

## Critical Issues

1. **Cannot activate plugin** - Missing vendor directory
2. **No admin functionality** - All admin pages are placeholders
3. **Emails won't send** - No email templates exist
4. **No Stripe Connect** - Cannot pay instructors
5. **No settings UI** - Cannot configure the plugin

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate fixes needed**:
   - Run `composer install` to create vendor directory
   - Create email templates (even basic ones)
   - Implement at least basic admin pages for Classes and Bookings

2. **High priority**:
   - Add Stripe Connect integration if instructor payouts are needed
   - Create settings page with configuration options
   - Add basic CSS styling

3. **Medium priority**:
   - Complete all admin pages
   - Add frontend templates
   - Implement package booking UI

## Conclusion

The plugin has excellent architecture and core business logic, but lacks the UI layer needed to actually use it. The backend services are production-ready, but the admin interface and email templates need to be built before the plugin can be used.
