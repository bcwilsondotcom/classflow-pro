# ClassFlow Pro Plugin Review

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing uninstall.php file
- **Issue**: Plugin had activation/deactivation hooks but no uninstall handler
- **Fixed**: Created comprehensive uninstall.php that removes all data when configured

### 2. ❌ Missing vendor directory
- **Issue**: Composer dependencies not installed
- **Action Required**: Run `composer install` to install required packages:
  - stripe/stripe-php: ^13.0
  - nesbot/carbon: ^2.72
  - ramsey/uuid: ^4.7

### 3. ✅ Missing admin page implementations
- **Issue**: AdminManager referenced pages that didn't exist
- **Fixed**: Created stub implementations for all admin pages:
  - ClassesPage.php
  - SchedulesPage.php
  - BookingsPage.php
  - StudentsPage.php
  - InstructorsPage.php
  - PaymentsPage.php
  - ReportsPage.php
  - SettingsPage.php

### 4. ✅ Missing shortcode implementations
- **Issue**: FrontendManager referenced shortcode classes that didn't exist
- **Fixed**: Created all shortcode classes with basic implementations

### 5. ✅ Missing repository registrations
- **Issue**: location_repository and payment_repository were not registered in container
- **Fixed**: Added registrations to Plugin.php

### 6. ✅ Package service reference
- **Issue**: Plugin.php referenced removed package_service
- **Fixed**: Commented out the line

### 7. ❌ Missing Stripe Connect Integration
- **Issue**: User specifically requested Stripe Connect integration but it's not implemented
- **Status**: The plugin currently has basic Stripe Payment Intents integration but lacks:
  - Stripe Connect onboarding flow
  - Connected account management
  - Platform fees and transfers
  - Instructor payouts

## Configuration Required

### Stripe Setup
The plugin expects these settings to be configured:
- `payment.stripe_test_secret_key`
- `payment.stripe_test_publishable_key`
- `payment.stripe_live_secret_key`
- `payment.stripe_live_publishable_key`
- `payment.stripe_webhook_secret`

## Next Steps

1. Run `composer install` to install dependencies
2. Configure Stripe API keys in settings
3. Implement Stripe Connect if needed for instructor payouts
4. Complete admin page implementations beyond stubs
5. Add proper form handling and validation
6. Implement email notification templates
7. Add unit tests for critical functionality

## Security Considerations

The plugin implements several security measures:
- ✅ Nonce verification in forms
- ✅ Capability checks for admin actions
- ✅ SQL prepared statements via repositories
- ✅ Proper data escaping in output
- ✅ XSS protection via esc_* functions

## Database Schema

The plugin creates 13 tables with proper foreign key relationships and indexes. All tables use the WordPress prefix and follow naming conventions.

## Overall Assessment

The plugin has a solid architectural foundation with:
- Clean domain-driven design
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Dependency injection container
- WordPress coding standards compliance

Main issues are missing Stripe Connect (if needed) and the vendor directory not being present.
